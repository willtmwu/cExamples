The 3 following folders: Server, Zone_isolation and Ethernet_over_UDP are the 3 assignment tasks completed for the COMP3301 UQ course, offered in Semester 2 of 2015. 

Server is a basic C server using event handling on sockets, while Zone_isolation and Ethernet_over_UDP are kernel code written for OpenBSD. 

Follow the OpenBSD instructions for compiling and running the kernel. 

*Disclaimer*
The code obviously has bugs that were not fixed in time, however the code achieved most of the functionality expected in the assignment specifications. All assignments achieved 80%+ marks.
