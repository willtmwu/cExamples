Description

The projects 'Zone Isolation' and 'Ethernet over UDP' are kernel code. 

To compile and run, please replace the files at the appropriate locations in the kernel. Or even safer, do a diff and replace lines. 

Then follow the OpenBSD instructions for compiling and running the kernel. 


*Disclaimer*
I have no idea what I was doing (most of the time)....... I had to grep the kernel
